Description: Collection of tools for assessment of feature importance and feature effects.
    Key functions are: 
    feature_importance() for assessment of global level feature importance, 
    ceteris_paribus() for calculation of the what-if plots,
    partial_dependency() for partial dependency plots,
    conditional_dependency() for conditional dependency plots,
    accumulated_dependency() for accumulated local effects plots,
    aggregate_profiles() and cluster_profiles() for aggregation of ceteris paribus profiles,
    theme_drwhy() with a 'ggplot2' skin for all plots,
    generic print() and plot() for better usability of selected explainers.
    The package 'ingredients' is a part of the 'DrWhy.AI' universe (Biecek 2018) <arXiv:1806.08915>.
