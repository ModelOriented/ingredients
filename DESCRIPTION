Description: Collection of tools for assessment of feature importance and feature effects.
    Key functions are:
    feature_importance() for assessment of global level feature importance,
    ceteris_paribus() for calculation of the what-if plots,
    partial_dependency() for partial dependency plots,
    conditional_dependency() for conditional dependency plots,
    accumulated_dependency() for accumulated local effects plots,
    aggregate_profiles() and cluster_profiles() for aggregation of ceteris paribus profiles,
    generic print() and plot() for better usability of selected explainers,
    generic plotD3() for interactive, D3 based explanations, and
    generic describe() for explanations in natural language.
