\title{Internal Function for Split Points for Selected Variables}
\usage{
calculate_variable_split(data, variables = colnames(data),
  grid_points = 101)

\method{calculate_variable_split}{default}(data,
  variables = colnames(data), grid_points = 101)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{validation dataset. Is used to determine distribution of observations.}

\item{variables}{names of variables for which splits shall be calculated}

\item{grid_points}{number of points used for response path}
}
\value{
A named list with splits for selected variables
}
\description{
This function calculate candidate splits for each selected variable.
For numerical variables splits are calculated as percentiles
(in general uniform quantiles of the length grid_points).
For all other variables splits are calculated as unique values.
}
\details{
Note that \code{\link{calculate_variable_split}} function is S3 generic.
If you want to work on non standard data sources (like H2O ddf, external databases)
you should overload it.
